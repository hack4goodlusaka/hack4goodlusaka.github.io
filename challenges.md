title: Climate Change Challenges
---
One of the critical factors for a successful hackathon project that gets real-world results is to pitch well-defined problem statements for teams to respond to. Successful, sustainable projects are created when organisations bring forwards key challenges and problem statements, collaborate with teams over the 48-hour event and show an ongoing commitment to creating real-world impact with these projects. We have engaged with various Challenge Partners that address the 15 global challenges of this hackathon.
